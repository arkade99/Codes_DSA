🔥 Love it. Let’s lock in a **30-day coding challenge roadmap** built exactly for your _“solve → understand → variation”_ method.

Each day has a **core problem** + **variation idea** so you always train deeper, not just memorize.

# 📅 30-Day Challenge Plan

### **Week 1 – Strings (Foundations)**

Two Pointers Technique
function test2(x,k){
const n = x.length;
let left = 0, right = n - 1;
while (left<right){
const sum =x[left]+x[right];
if (sum===k){
return true;
}
if (sum > k){
right--
}
if(sum<k){
left++
}
}
return false
}
console.log(test2([2,5,8,12,30], 13));

1. Palindrome check → Variation: two-pointer method
   function test2(x){
   x= x.toLowerCase().split("")
   let l = 0, r= x.length-1;
   while(l<r){
   if (x[l]!==x[r]){
   return false
   }
   else{
   l=l+1;
   r=r-1;
   }
   }
   return true  
   }
   console.log(test2('Madam'));
2. Reverse a string → Variation: manual loop vs `.reverse()`
3. Count vowels in a string → Variation: regex vs loop
4. Check anagram → Variation: sorting vs hash map
5. First non-repeating character → Variation: hash map vs indexOf/lastIndexOf
6. Check if string has all unique characters → Variation: Set vs manual count
7. Longest word in a sentence → Variation: split/reduce vs loop

---

### **Week 2 – Arrays (Core Data Structures)**

8. Find max & min in array → Variation: Math.max vs loop
9. Sum of array → Variation: loop vs `reduce()`
10. Remove duplicates → Variation: Set vs filter
11. Merge two arrays & sort → Variation: spread vs manual merge
12. Rotate array by k → Variation: slice/concat vs in-place swap
13. Check if array is sorted → Variation: loop vs `.every()`
14. Find second largest element → Variation: sort vs one-pass

---

### **Week 3 – Numbers & Logic**

15. FizzBuzz → Variation: if/else vs map
16. Prime number check → Variation: loop till n vs sqrt(n)
17. Factorial → Variation: recursion vs loop
18. Fibonacci series → Variation: recursion vs DP/memoization
19. Armstrong number check → Variation: while loop vs string methods
20. GCD of two numbers → Variation: Euclidean algorithm vs brute force
21. Count digits of number → Variation: loop vs `toString().length`

---

### **Week 4 – Mixed Problems & Interview Style**

22. Two Sum → Variation: brute force vs hash map
23. Majority element in array → Variation: count map vs Boyer-Moore
24. Move zeroes to end → Variation: filter/concat vs in-place
25. Missing number in array (1 to n) → Variation: sum formula vs XOR
26. Find intersection of two arrays → Variation: filter vs Set
27. Longest common prefix → Variation: sorting vs vertical scan
28. Valid parentheses → Variation: stack vs replace method
29. Group anagrams → Variation: sort string vs frequency map
30. Implement debounce function → Variation: throttle vs debounce

# 🧠 How to Use This

- **Daily:**

  - Solve with 1 method (5 min).
  - Break down step-by-step what each line does (5 min).
  - Implement 1 variation (5 min).

- **Weekly Sunday Review:**

  - Pick 2 problems from the week.
  - Explain them _out loud_ as if teaching a junior dev.
  - That cements real understanding.

---

By the end of **30 days**, you’ll have:

- 30 problems × 2 solutions each = **60 patterns in your brain**
- GitHub activity streak = recruiters love it
- Confidence to handle any **DSA-style React interview questions**

👉 Do you want me to make this into a **Notion/Excel tracker template** where you can tick off problems daily + write notes, so you can visually see progress?
